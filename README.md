# FloodSight: A flood risk classifier

## **Problem Statement**

- Timely and accurate flood risk assessment is critical for everyday commuters to recognize if the route is safe or not.
- Existing systems often rely on static models or delayed reporting, failing to provide the dynamic, hyper-localized information needed for rapid decision-making.
- The FloodSight project addresses this by developing a machine learning-powered system that ingests real-time environmental data (rainfall, tide levels, weather forecasts) to classify flood risk severity.
- The core objective is to deliver immediate, actionable intelligence through a responsive dashboard featuring three distinct severity levels:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Safe: No immediate risk detected.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Warning: Elevated risk; monitor conditions closely.
  - ðŸ”´ Evacuation: Imminent danger; immediate action required.
- Crucially, the system integrates with the OpenWeathermanAPI to provide users whether the area is safe or not, with the weather forecast and also 3 navigable route suggestion.
- This combination of classification and dynamic routing transforms raw data into life-saving operational capacity.
